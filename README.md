### Clean outputs
```
$ make clean
rm -rf work && rm -rf pipeline_out
```
## Templates
The templates folder contains the scripts that run the pipeline. To run an individual step, define all nextflow context variables (e.g. all variables specified in a process's `input`), and run call that script directly.

### Detect Runs
```
$ ls Run_to_Demux.txt 		# Should error, no file 
ls: cannot access Run_to_Demux.txt: No such file or directory

$ SEQUENCER_DIR="/igo/sequencers" RUN_AGE=6000 RUNS_TO_DEMUX_FILE="Run_to_Demux.txt" ./templates/detect_runs.sh
