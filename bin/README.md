# Nextflow Third Party Scripts

From the nextflow documentation,
> Any third party script that does not need to be compiled (Bash, Python, Perl, etc) can be included in the pipeline project repository, so that they are distributed with it. Grant the execute permission to these files and copy them into a folder named bin/ in the root directory of your project repository. Nextflow will automatically add this folder to the PATH environment variable, and the scripts will automatically be accessible in your pipeline without the need to specify an absolute path to invoke them.
